# TechnicalTestApplication

This is a submission for a postion in currencyfair Dublin. The project is rather simple 
* REST service which saves to a _database_ (static map used for time saving purposes), 
* generates simple statistics and 
* renders them using a JSP and javascipt charts.

Unit tests have also been written to show knowledge of different approaches 
1) Standard JUnit testing, 
2) using mocks and stubs, 
3) Unit testing private methods
4) Accessing and updating private attributes
5) Loading full application into memory and performing end-to-end test scenarios.
